Predicting sales from a bakery transactions

Transactions from a Bakery

As part of my data science course I am going to predict daily transactions from a bakery using a dataset from Kaggle, in addition I am using a temperature dataset and local events.

Files and what they do:

1.Bakery_Analysis
EDA

2.Bakery_Linear_Regression_with_Events.ipynb
Use linear regression, Ridge and Lasso to predict total sales using days of the week as dummy predictors as well as is_local_event and is_bank_holiday.

3.Bakery_Prediction_With_Decision_tree_and_Random_Forest_with_is_event.ipynb
Use Decision Tree and Random Forest to predict total sales using days of the week as dummy predictors as well as is_local_event and is_bank_holiday

4.Comparison.ipynb

Pre work files
Pre_Work_1.Weather_dataset
Load weather dataset and extract date time and temperatures. 

Pre_Work_1a.Bakery_Prediction_Temperature
Use linear to predict total sales using temperature as the predictor.

Pre_Work_1b.Hot_drink_Prediction_Temperature
Use linear regression to predict total hot drinks sales using temperature as the predictor.

Pre_Work_2.Bakery_Linear_Regression
Use linear regression, Ridge and Lasso to predict total sales using days of the week as dummy predictors.

Pre_Work_3.Time_Series
Use Time series to predict total sales.
